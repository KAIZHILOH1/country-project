      <p>Malaysia is a diverse Southeast Asian country divided into two main regions: Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia (on the island of Borneo). The country's geography is characterized by coastal plains, rolling hills, and mountainous terrain, with tropical rainforests covering a significant portion of its land. Historically, Malaysia's strategic location along important trade routes has shaped its development. The region was influenced by various empires and colonial powers, including Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms, Islamic sultanates, and later, Portuguese, Dutch, and British colonizers. Malaysia gained independence from British rule in 1957, forming the Federation of Malaya, which later expanded to include Sabah and Sarawak, becoming modern-day Malaysia in 1963. Today, the country is known for its multicultural society, blending Malay, Chinese, Indian, and indigenous influences, which is reflected in its rich cultural heritage, diverse cuisine, and unique architectural landmarks. </p>
