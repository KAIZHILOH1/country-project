	In our opinion, going up the Petronas is definitely worth the money! Especially since the Petronas Twin Towers are the landmark of Kuala Lumpur and Malaysia. We really found it interesting to get the inside perspective from this impressive building, now that we'd seen it sooo many times from the outside.We recommend going for sunrise or sunset. We opted for the 6:15pm time slot so that we could watch the sunset from the Petronas Towers. If you are a morning person and love sunrises you can pick a morning time slot.
